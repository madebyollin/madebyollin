    <h2>1. AVs must be superhuman just to break even.</h2>
<p>I'm picturing the matchup like this:</p>

<p><img src="1.jpg" /></p>

<p><strong>AVs will be inferior at:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Interpreting Edge Cases</strong>: Andrej Karpathy has a <a href="https://youtu.be/zywIvINSlaI?t=1245">nice compilation of these</a> that should frighten any AV engineer. Sacha Arnoud and Drago Anguelov (Waymo) have <a href="https://youtu.be/LSX3qdy0dFg?t=1870">have</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/Q0nGo2-y0xY?t=349">more</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Acting to Reduce Uncertainty</strong>: <a href="https://medium.com/waymo/a-better-view-on-how-our-vehicles-make-a-right-on-turn-on-red-ecdbc72cbd17">Hand-designed recovery rules</a> with <a href="https://youtu.be/zywIvINSlaI?t=1537">machine-learned triggers</a> should be enough to handle most common cases, but not all of them.</li>
    <li><strong>Self-Improvement</strong>: humans can learn from their failures without needing to upload them to the cloud, wait for an engineer to build a fix, and pull the fix back down over Wi-Fi...</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>AVs could be superior at:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mapping</strong>: AVs can have centimeter-accurate localization in richly-detailed maps.</li>
    <li><strong>Surround Perception</strong>: AVs can be watching every direction at once, with multiple sensors, at all times, without getting distracted.</li>
    <li><strong>Low Latency</strong>: AVs can (in theory) have reaction times in the ones or tens of milliseconds, instead of the thousands.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. AVs need to track uncertainty and reduce it over time.</h2>

<p>...because uncertainty is necessary for fault-tolerant intelligence.</p>

<!-- <div id="bayes_filter_demo_wrap"></div> -->
<!-- if we have js, add a cute demo -->
<!-- nvm too lazy -->
<!-- <script src="bayes_filter_demo.js"></script> -->

<p>Any line of code that looks like <code>if (p_x > threshold)</code> (binarizing a confidence estimate) or <code>x = argmax(x_likelihoods)</code> (binarizing a distribution) is going to cause a comical failure eventually.</p>

<p>If you forgo uncertainty at one layer in your perception stack, you're doomed to approximate the uncertainty with temporal smoothing at the next level up; the end result of this approach is a card tower of progressively-worse approximations.</p>

<p>(Corollary: systems that devote all of their energy to good <a href="http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/">per-frame results</a> will fare poorly. The real world is not a benchmark, frames are not i.i.d, and it's usually better to run a dumber system at higher framerates with <a href="https://youtu.be/BBw7b4SUlto?t=692">good cross-frame tracking</a>.)</p>

<h2>3. AVs that work anywhere must first work everywhere (cautiously)</h2>
<p><img src="2.jpg" /></p>
<p>I am very pessimistic about systems that start by assuming an idealized environment and attempt to special-case for harder ones. Starting with minimal assumptions about the environment is another form of built-in fault tolerance.</p>
<p>Successful systems will start with a foundation of content-agnostic environment reconstruction (through LIDAR, stereo, SFM/MVS, whatever) + obstacle avoidance, and special-case upwards. <em>If</em> there are line lines, use them as a strong prior for where to drive. <em>If</em> some obstacles are recognizable as cars and pedestrians, use stronger assumptions about how those obstacles will move. <em>If</em> you can recognize an obstacle as a plastic bag or a cloud of exhaust, you can safely run into it. But only then.</p>
